<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>Customer churn as defined by <a href='https://www.paddle.com/resources/customer-churn' to='_blank'>Paddle</a> is the loss of subscribers or customers, can have a huge impact on any company's revenue stream. While several revenue models exist, being able to retain customers still remains crucial for maximizing profits. This project focuses on tackling this challenge by building a robust machine learning model to predict customer churn.</p>

<p>By proactively identifying customers at risk of leaving, companies can implement targeted interventions like incentives, personalized offers, or improved customer service to encourage them to stay. This predictive approach enables businesses to:</p>

* Reduce customer churn rate and increase customer lifetime value.
* Optimize resource allocation by focusing retention efforts on at-risk customers.
* Gain valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.

<p>The success of this project lies in building a highly accurate and interpretable machine learning model. This will require carefully chosen data features, effective model selection, and rigorous evaluation techniques. Ultimately, this project aims to equip companies with a powerful tool to combat customer churn and achieve sustainable growth.</p>
